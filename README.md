# daysCalc
 ## My first C++ Project - calculate days between dates and other useful date related utilities.
 
 It has a TUI to:
 - Tell the user if a year is a leap year,
 - Tell the user how many days there are between dates,
 - Tell the user which weekday a date falls on.
 - MORE IS PLANNED
### TODOs
- Make it tell the user how many days they have been alive (AND FIND THE CURRENT DATE, NOT ASK FOR INPUT)
- Find dates based on distance from another, (Days, Months, possibly years? not interesting enough)
- Make it look better (Curses? I will do this later on.)
### TODON'TS
- Make it compatable with the julian calender.
